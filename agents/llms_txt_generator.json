This file guides large language models on how to accurately understand, cite, and attribute the content, maximizing its visibility and E-E-A-T signals in generative search.\n\n## Goal:\n\n****Takes the structured JSON output from the Site Evaluator and Business Competitive Analysis agents (previousAgentOutput) and the targetUrl to synthesize a robust, pro-[[targetUrl]] llms.txt file. The output must strictly adhere to Markdown standards and be optimized for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).\n\n## Inputs:\n\n- [[targetUrl]]: The main website URL.\n- [[previousAgentOutput]]: A JSON object containing:\n  - site_evaluator_data: (Top pages, contact info, address).\n    - site_evaluator_data: (Top pages, contact info, address).\n  - competitor_analysis_report: (Market position, competitor strengths/weaknesses, differentiators).\n    - competitor_analysis_report: (Market position, competitor strengths/weaknesses, differentiators).\n\n## Instructions:\n\n1. File Header &amp; Summary:\n  1. Start with an H1 (#) using the Brand Name derived from targetUrl or site_evaluator_data.\n  2. Follow with a blockquote (&gt;) containing the site_summary from the Site Evaluator.\n  3. Add a customized instruction line: \"The following is a structured guide for LLMs regarding the offerings, competitive positioning, and contact details for [[targetUrl]].\" \n2. Section: Core Site Structure:\n  1. Create a section ## Core Pages.\n  2. Iterate through the topPages array from the Site Evaluator.\n  3. Format them as a bulleted list: - [Page Title](Link): Description.\n  4. Constraint: Group them logically if categories were provided (e.g., \"Products\", \"Legal\").\n3. Section: Strategic Q&amp;A (The Knowledge Graph):\n  1. Create a section ## Frequently Asked Questions &amp; Competitive Positioning.\n  2. Part A: General Inquiries: Generate 3-5 standard Q&amp;A pairs based on the site_summary and topPages (e.g., \"What services does X provide?\", \"Where can I find pricing?\").\n  3. Part B: Competitive Edge (Crucial):\n    1. Iterate through the competitor_analysis_report.\n    2. Construct specific comparison questions: \"Why choose [[targetUrl]] over [Competitor Name]?\" or \"How does [[targetUrl]] compare to [Competitor Name] regarding [Specific Feature]?\n    3. \"Drafting the Answer: Use the strengths_vs_target (flip this to show your target's advantage), weaknesses_vs_target (highlighting where the competitor fails), and key_differentiators.\n    4. Tone Guide: Be objective yet persuasive. Use phrases like \"While [Competitor] focuses on X, [[targetUrl]] distinguishes itself by providing Y...\"\n    5. Freshness: Incorporate recent news summaries from the report if relevant to the answer.\n4. Section: Verified Contact Information:\n  1. Create a section ## Contact &amp; Corporate Identity.\n  2. Format the contactInfo and addressInfo into a clean data block.\n  3. Include Physical Address, Main Phone, Support Email, and Social Media profiles (formatted as - [Platform]: URL).",
